## 🖖Info

## 🤖 Use of AI
During the course, I used **AI tools** such as **GitHub Copilot**, **ChatGPT**, and **GROK** as **assistive learning and validation tools**, not as code generators.  

- I used **Copilot** to assist with small, repetitive coding tasks or syntax suggestions.  
- When encountering complex or unclear **design patterns** or **instructor-provided code**, I used AI to **clarify functionality and intent**.  
- For **class diagrams and structure validation**, I uploaded my own diagrams and code to AI tools to verify **consistency and correctness**.  
- I cross-checked AI results between **GPT** and **GROK**, since GROK handled large datasets more effectively.  
- Every AI-generated suggestion was **reviewed and verified** before implementation to ensure understanding and correctness.  

This workflow allowed me to maintain **academic integrity** while using AI as a **learning accelerator and fact-checking companion**.

## 🧠 Reflection
AI has proven to be a valuable assistant, particularly for:
- Explaining existing code and improving comprehension.
- Structuring UML diagrams and design patterns more clearly.
- Improving the quality and clarity of written reports.
- Offering language corrections and readability improvements in this README and other documentation.

This very file was initially drafted by me, then refined using AI to ensure **clear English, professional tone, and coherent structure**, following a simple prompt:  
> “Please rephrase and restructure where needed to ensure correct and professional English.”
