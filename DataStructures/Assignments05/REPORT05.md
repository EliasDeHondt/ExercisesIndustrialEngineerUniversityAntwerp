## 🖖Info

1. We can use a binary tree to represent a mathematical expression, which traversal method should we use to evaluate the expression? Why can’t we use the others?

2. If you assume a sorted binary tree (Such as the one shown in the figure), what is the time-complexity of finding a node with a given value?
> 

3. We can also use binary trees to build N-ary trees, how would you tackle this?
